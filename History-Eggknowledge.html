	<h1>The Evolution of the Egg industry</h1>
</div>

<div id="History-TextBody">
	<h3>Early History</h3>
	<p>Eggs have been a dietary staple for centuries, but egg production in the United States began in earnest during the 19th century. Initially, egg production was a backyard enterprise, with families raising small flocks of chickens for both meat and eggs.</p>
</div>


<div id="HistoryIndust-TextBody">
	<h3>Industrialization and Urbanization</h3>
	<p>As the United States underwent rapid industrialization and urbanization in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, demand for eggs surged. Small-scale poultry farming gradually gave way to larger, more efficient operations.</p>
</div>


<div id="HistoryComm-TextBody">
	<h3>Emergence of Commercial Egg Production</h3>
	<p>The early 20th century saw the emergence of commercial egg production. Farmers began to specialize in egg production, using selective breeding to develop strains of chickens optimized for egg-laying.</p>
</div>

<div id="HistoryTech-TextBody">
	<h3>Technological Advances</h3>
	<p>Throughout the 20th century, technological advances revolutionized egg production. These included improved housing systems, such as battery cages and later, enriched colony cages, which allowed for higher densities of birds and more efficient egg collection.</p>
</div>

<div id="HistoryCons-TextBody">
	<h3>Industry Consolidation</h3>
	<p>The mid to late 20th century saw significant consolidation in the egg industry, with small family farms being replaced by large-scale commercial operations. This consolidation was driven by economies of scale and increased demand for eggs.</p>
</div>


<div id="HistoryGov-TextBody">
	<h3>Government Regulation</h3>
	<p>The federal government began to regulate egg production in the early 20th century to ensure food safety and quality. The USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) plays a key role in setting standards for egg production and inspecting egg facilities.</p>
</div>


<div id="HistoryConsumer-TextBody">
	<h3>Consumer Concerns and Welfare Issues</h3>
	<p>In recent decades, there has been growing concern among consumers and animal welfare advocates about the welfare of egg-laying hens in intensive production systems. This has led to increased demand for cage-free and free-range eggs, as well as regulatory changes aimed at improving the welfare of laying hens.</p>
</div>


<div id="HistoryEnviro-TextBody">
	<h3>Sustainability and Environmental Concerns</h3>
	<p>More recently, there has been a focus on the environmental sustainability of egg production, including issues such as water usage, waste management, and greenhouse gas emissions. This has led to efforts to develop more sustainable practices, such as alternative housing systems and feed formulations.</p>
