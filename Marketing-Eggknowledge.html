	<h2>How Eggs are Marketed</h2>
	<p>There are a variety of ways egg producers will market eggs to consumers. Since there are 3 main egg "production styles" (normal caged eggs, free range, and pasture raised), we will briefly look at all 3 to determine the differences and how it might effect the costs.</p>

<div id="cagedeggs-body">
	<h3>Normal Egg production AKA (caged eggs)</h3>

<div class="whiteegg-pic">

  </div>

<p>White eggs in a grocery store are typically associated with typical commercial egg farming standards, that is White Leghorns being raised in caged environments. Marketing for this style of eggs is minimal in this day in age. The most marketing you would see come from commercial farms of this type would be from a brand called Eggland. They boast of being the best in regards to vitamins compared to other egg brands and that their chickens are fed an all vegetarian diet. A consumer could expect to pay on average a dollar or two more than the store brand white eggs depending on their location.</p>

<div id="cagefree-body">
	<h3>Free Range Eggs</h3>

  </div>

<p>In commercial operations free range eggs can sometimes be referred to as "cage free". The meaning is the same, it just depends on the compant and their marketing. Free range eggs are when the chickens are still housed in a climate controlled environment (usually) but they are not in cages. This allows the companies to boast that their eggs are "cage free" all the while the chickens remain confined amongst other chicken in a crowded chicken house. Often times the company will boast about how many sqft there are per chicken when they market their cage free eggs.</p>

<div id="pastureraised-body">
	<h3>Pasture Raised Eggs</h3>

<div class="pastureraisedeggs-pic">
    <img src="pastureraisedeggs.jpg" alt="">
  </div>

<p>The "newer" trend for egg marketing is calling your eggs pasture raised. And rightfully so, they are in fact pasture raised. Eggs from chickens that are pasture raised tend to have more of a vibrant color yoke compared to that of a chicen who was raised in a cage or even cage free. Consumers have been flocking to these eggs. A perfect example is <a href="https://vitalfarms.com/pasture-raised-eggs/" style="color: blue;">Vital Farms.</a> They have emerged as a leading egg brand in the pasture raised egg market charging a premium for their eggs, Where a dozen of eggs are going for $7-8 dollars. </p>
