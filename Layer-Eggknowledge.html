	<h2>Types of Layer Birds</h2>
	<p>There are a variety of layer birds. Some are commonly known, and other are not so common. We are only going to focus on two different types of layer birds. One will be the White Leghorn, the one most commonly associated with producing white eggs that you would find in the store. And the other layer bird we will focus on is the Rhode Island Red, the bird most associated with "organic" eggs that you would find in the store.</p>

<p>White Leghorn chickens are a cornerstone of the commercial chicken industry due to their exceptional egg-laying abilities and efficiency in feed conversion. Renowned for their production of large, white eggs, White Leghorns are favored by commercial egg producers worldwide. Their adaptability to various climates and environments, coupled with their high feed efficiency, make them cost-effective for large-scale operations. Additionally, their robustness and disease resistance further enhance their appeal to commercial poultry farmers. With their consistent performance and reliable egg production, White Leghorns continue to play a vital role in meeting the global demand for eggs in the commercial market. <a href="https://youtu.be/hWV6fvmKNsQ?si=9jsDBjahZly-n7lH" style="color: blue;">Here is a good example of the White Leghorn and it's traits.</a></p>

<p>Rhode Island Red chickens are valued in the commercial egg industry for their dual-purpose capabilities. While they may not lay as many eggs as specialized breeds like the White Leghorn, Rhode Island Reds are prized for their large brown eggs and steady production throughout the year. Their hardiness, adaptability to various climates, and docile temperament make them well-suited for commercial egg operations. Moreover, their ability to forage efficiently contributes to lower feed costs, further enhancing their appeal to producers. Rhode Island Reds remain a popular choice for commercial egg farming, providing both economic viability and product diversity.</p>
